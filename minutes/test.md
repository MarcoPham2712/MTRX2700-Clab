|--------------------------------------------|--------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| a) Delay Function Using TIM2               | ✅     | [Name B]  | Accepts microsecond value in R1; waits until CNT > target         |
| b) Prescaler Justification & Calculation   | ✅     | [Name C]  | Documented values for 1μs, 1s, 1h. Used for PWM test               |
| c) ARR Preload Delay                       | ✅     | [Name B]  | TIMx_ARR + ARPE=1 used for accurate 0.1ms delay cycle              |
| PWM Loop for LED Blink                     | ✅     | [Name B]  | 500ms toggling LED based on vowel/consonant count planned          |

----> Verified timing loop with oscilloscope. Accuracy consistent across test runs.

## 4. Key Issues and Solutions

| Issue                            | Resolution                                                             |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| UART not transmitting full string| Ensured terminating character is detected before sending              |
| Baud mismatch between devices    | Standardized to 115200 baud on both devices, adjusted clock divisor   |
| Timer not resetting CNT          | Added manual reset `STR R8, [R0, TIM_CNT]` before delay loop          |
| Button debounce for send trigger| Added ~100ms delay after button press to prevent repeated sends       |
